### 2. **Linux System Programming** 📚
- **Duration**: 10 sessions (25-02-2024 to 08-05-2024)
- **Instructor**: Eng. Reda Maher, Senior Staff Software Engineer
- This section was primarily focused on reading *The Linux Programming Interface* by **Michael Kerrisk**, a highly recommended resource for mastering system-level programming in Linux. We also introduced **version control with Git** to effectively manage code and collaborate.

#### **Chapters Studied**:
- **Chapter 1: History and Standards** 🏛️: Discussed Linux’s development and the standards that shape system programming.
- **Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts** 💡: Introduced the basic concepts such as system calls, file descriptors, and the Linux kernel.
- **Chapter 3: System Programming Concepts** ⚙️: Covered the essentials of system programming and interaction with the kernel.
- **Chapter 4: File I/O: The Universal I/O Model** 💾: Delved into Linux’s approach to input/output operations, including file descriptors and stream handling.
- **Chapter 5: File I/O: Further Details** 🗂️: Explored deeper aspects of file operations, like file locking and asynchronous I/O.
- **Chapter 6: Processes** 🏃: Studied process creation, scheduling, and lifecycle management.
- **Chapter 7: Memory Allocation** 🧠: Discussed the various memory management strategies used by Linux, including heap and stack allocation.
- **Chapter 8: Users and Groups** 👥: Understanding user permissions, groups, and how Linux handles multi-user systems.
- **Chapter 9: Process Credentials** 🔑: Covered the security features in Linux related to user authentication, privileges, and capabilities.
- **Chapter 10: Time** ⏰: Understanding time management in Linux, including system time, clocks, and scheduling.

#### **Project**:
- Implemented a **heap memory management system** that simulated memory allocation/deallocation in C, providing insights into how memory is managed within a process 🏗️.
