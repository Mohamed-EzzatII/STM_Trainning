# STM Training - Linux System Programming 🚀

This repository contains my work from the **STM Training** program — an immersive 9-month course at **STMicroelectronics Cairo branch**. This training focused on an in-depth exploration of **Linux System Programming** and **Kernel Interface** 🖥️🐧. It helped me build a strong foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of Linux, preparing me for advanced development and system-level programming.

### **Training Breakdown:**

The training was divided into three distinct parts, each focusing on different areas of Linux system programming and the kernel interface. 🌱

### 1. **Introduction to Linux System Programming** 🛠️
- **Duration**: 9 sessions (28-01-2024 to 15-02-2024)
- **Instructor**: Eng. Reda Maher, Senior Staff Software Engineer
- In this section, I gained a basic understanding of the Linux operating system and its underlying components. This was a crucial first step in my journey into Linux system programming.

#### **Topics Covered**:
- **Overview of Linux history** 📜: Studied the evolution of Linux, from its origins to its current position as a dominant OS.
- **Introduction to Virtualization** 🌐: Learned how virtualization works in Linux and its role in cloud computing and containerization.
- **Basic command-line usage and build process** 🖱️: Focused on essential shell commands, scripting, and compiling software in Linux.
- **Linux internals** 🔧: Gained an understanding of the architecture of the Linux kernel and its subsystems.
- **Linux Process Management** ⚙️: Explored processes in Linux, including creation, scheduling, and termination.
- **Intro to User Management** 👤: Covered how user accounts and permissions are managed in Linux systems.
- **Filesystem Structure** 🗂️: Understand how Linux handles files and directories, and how filesystem hierarchy is structured.

#### **Project**:
- Developed a **simple shell** program that supports basic commands, simulating how the shell interacts with users and the operating system 🐚.

### 2. **Linux System Programming** 📚
- **Duration**: 10 sessions (25-02-2024 to 08-05-2024)
- **Instructor**: Eng. Reda Maher, Senior Staff Software Engineer
- This section was primarily focused on reading *The Linux Programming Interface* by **Michael Kerrisk**, a highly recommended resource for mastering system-level programming in Linux. We also introduced **version control with Git** to effectively manage code and collaborate.

#### **Chapters Studied**:
- **Chapter 1: History and Standards** 🏛️: Discussed Linux’s development and the standards that shape system programming.
- **Chapter 2: Fundamental Concepts** 💡: Introduced the basic concepts such as system calls, file descriptors, and the Linux kernel.
- **Chapter 3: System Programming Concepts** ⚙️: Covered the essentials of system programming and interaction with the kernel.
- **Chapter 4: File I/O: The Universal I/O Model** 💾: Delved into Linux’s approach to input/output operations, including file descriptors and stream handling.
- **Chapter 5: File I/O: Further Details** 🗂️: Explored deeper aspects of file operations, like file locking and asynchronous I/O.
- **Chapter 6: Processes** 🏃: Studied process creation, scheduling, and lifecycle management.
- **Chapter 7: Memory Allocation** 🧠: Discussed the various memory management strategies used by Linux, including heap and stack allocation.
- **Chapter 8: Users and Groups** 👥: Understanding user permissions, groups, and how Linux handles multi-user systems.
- **Chapter 9: Process Credentials** 🔑: Covered the security features in Linux related to user authentication, privileges, and capabilities.
- **Chapter 10: Time** ⏰: Understanding time management in Linux, including system time, clocks, and scheduling.

#### **Project**:
- Implemented a **heap memory management system** that simulated memory allocation/deallocation in C, providing insights into how memory is managed within a process 🏗️.

### 3. **Advanced Linux System Programming & Kernel Interface** 🔥
- **Duration**: 9 sessions (01-07-2024 to 07-09-2024)
- **Instructor**: Dr. Hazem Nassef
- This was the final section, where we explored more advanced topics in Linux, focusing on kernel programming, containerization, and networking.

#### **Topics Covered**:
- **Kernel Namespaces and Containers** 📦: Gained deep insights into kernel namespaces, which isolate resources, and containers (e.g., Docker), which leverage these namespaces for efficient resource allocation.
- **TCP/IP Stack and Socket Programming** 🌐: Covered networking concepts, from the basics of TCP/IP to implementing client-server applications using sockets.
- **Signals and Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** 📡: Explored signals and IPC mechanisms such as message queues, semaphores, and shared memory, crucial for communication between processes.
- **Building Linux Distributions using Yocto** 🛠️: Learned about Yocto, an open-source project that allows the creation of custom Linux distributions for embedded systems.
- **POSIX Threads** 🧵: Delved into multi-threading in Linux, including thread creation, synchronization, and the POSIX threading API.
- **Introduction to Kernel Modules** 🔧: Introduced the concept of kernel modules, which allow the kernel to be extended without rebooting the system.

### **Final Thoughts** 🎓:
This **9-month training journey** was an invaluable experience that provided a deep dive into Linux System Programming and Kernel Interfaces. From understanding the basics of Linux to diving into more advanced topics like kernel modules and network programming, I gained critical skills and knowledge. I now feel well-prepared to pursue more advanced projects in system-level programming, embedded systems, and even contribute to open-source Linux projects. 🖥️🔍

This training has equipped me with the confidence and expertise to tackle challenges in Linux development and system architecture, setting the stage for my career as a Linux systems programmer. 🚀
